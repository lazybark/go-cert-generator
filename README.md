# cert-generator
It's an easy-to-use CLI tool to create self-signed certs in PEM-files. Useful for testing stuff or making little server-client apps. For example, [go-tls-server](https://github.com/lazybark/go-tls-server).

Use is quite simple: just follow app's instructions in console and provide Org name, host, cert lifetime in days, key usage types and exported file names.
